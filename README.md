Space game ðŸš€ðŸ‘½ 

When you hit space you are a rocket flying through space collecting stars trying to reach the different planets (levels). At each planet there is a boss against an alien, where you need to make him good again! While flying through the space it has to fly pass alien ships or meteros or comets (can shoot them down).

To begin, worked through this tutorial in the practice file: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Create_the_Canvas_and_draw_on_it

Additionally worked through this tutorial on using Phaser 3 framework: http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game

Currently working on basic game mechanics with free game assets (need to replace those assets later on with own assets)
